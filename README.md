This repository is the implementation of A-Star path planning algorithm on the 2-D matrix. It is implemented on a ROBOTIS Turtle Bot 3 and is usable by any differential drive robot using ROS NOETIC. This project is developed by Mohd Farhan Haroon, at the Integral Robotics Lab, Integral University, Lucknow. Contact me at farhanhar@student.iul.ac.in
